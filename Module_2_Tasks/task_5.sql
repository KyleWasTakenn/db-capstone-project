/*
In the second task, Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail.
This prepared statement will help to reduce the parsing time of queries.
It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.

The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable.

The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯

-- Used 501 since that is the first Order ID in my generated testing data.
